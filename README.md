# Projeto Integrador

Project developed for the discipline at Uniso (University of Sorocaba) called Integrator Project, with the aim of creating a website that connects university students with each other to take extra classes, enabling some students to tutor others.
The applications were made using Angular CLI, with Ng directives, components and services to build the Front End, while Django API Rest Framework was used to create the Back End to connect to the MySQL database, creating a fullstack project.
In total this was done in 4 months, from prototyping in Figma to the beta version, where the project only worked on the local computer, without connection to any external Django server, just the local one
